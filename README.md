# Droid Socket Finder
A Python script for mapping local sockets to their corresponding processes.  I believe the original script was published on Wooyun around 2015.

## Setup

* Create a ```bin``` directory underneath the root folder and drop in ```adb```
* Use PIP to install the required packages

## Usage
```python 
python run.py
```
